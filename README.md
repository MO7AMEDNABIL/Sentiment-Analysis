# Sentiment-Analysis


 This project implements a Sentiment Analysis model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks) in TensorFlow/Keras.
It classifies text (e.g., reviews, tweets, or comments) into categories such as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

📌 Features

Preprocesses text (tokenization, padding, stopword removal).

Uses Embedding + BiLSTM layers for sequential learning.

Can handle multiple sentiment classes.

Trains on labeled datasets and evaluates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/MO7AMEDNABIL/Sentiment-Analysis.git
cd Sentiment-Analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt

🚀 Usage
1. Train the model
python train.py

2. Evaluate the model
python evaluate.py

3. Predict on new text
from model import predict_sentiment

text = "I love this product!"
print(predict_sentiment(text))

📊 Example Results
Text	Prediction
"I love this product!"	Positive
"This is the worst service."	Negative
"It was okay, nothing great."	Neutral
